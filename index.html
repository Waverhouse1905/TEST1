<h1>Welcome to the Bavarian Neoliberal Club!</h1>

<h2>What is the Bavarian Neoliberal Club?</h2>

<p>
The Bavarian Neoliberal Club is a privately financed organization representing Neoliberal values. <br> 
Our Headquarters are based in Bavaria, Germany, but we have since branched out into many different countries. <br>
As of 2020, we have over 20.000 members world wide.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>

<p>
We seek to further our understanding of Neoliberalism through heated debate and close study of recent emperical research </br>
Anyone is welcome to join our organization or simply participate in our debates. </br>
This is because, we recognize that free speech is not just another value such as benevolence or loyalty.</br>
Free speech is the central mechanism holding together our civilization by making it possible to refine our ideas in civil debate. </br>
In that sense, we seek to have firm resolve and take pride in our outspokenness - like Bavaria's spirit animal:
